		    My name is Jack Shorenstein, and I am a student living in Meridian, Idaho (a city right outside of Boise, Idaho). I am good with programming, but my main specialty is working with servers on platforms like AWS/Amazon Web Services and GCP/Google Cloud Platform! I am also familiar with Linux and HTML programming! This website (as well as Old.JackShorenstein.com) is hosted on a Raspberry Pi that I have at home.
